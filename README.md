# Simulator-COA




**Project Overview:**<br>

This project is an Instruction Set Simulator built in Python to simulate the execution of various instructions such as add, addi, sub, and more. The simulator models a multi-core environment, demonstrating how instructions are fetched, decoded, executed, and how registers and memory are managed during program execution.
