# Simulator-COA




## Project Overview:<br>

This project is an Instruction Set Simulator built in Python to simulate the execution of various instructions such as add, addi, sub, and more. The simulator models a multi-core environment, demonstrating how instructions are fetched, decoded, executed, and how registers and memory are managed during program execution.

## Features:<br>

1.Instruction Support: Supports a range of instructions such as add, addi, lw, sw, beq, bne, etc.<br>
2.Register and Memory Management: Simulates a register file and memory operations.<br>
3.Detailed Output: Provides step-by-step execution details, including register and memory states.<br>
